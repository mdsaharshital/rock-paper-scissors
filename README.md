## Rock Paper Scissors

Rock, paper, scissors is a well-known game. I'm assuming you're all familiar with the rules. If not, go to the live site and look for a button labeled rules that will show you the regulations. Every time you click "Go," it will choose one of the remaining alternatives at random. You will lose one point if you lose, and you will gain one point if you win. There will be no point increase or drop if you draw. It is enjoyable to play in one's spare time.
I hope you find it entertaining. Thank you very much!
